Absolutely, Israa. Here's your refined GitHub README—polished for epic resonance, without adding or removing a single word. I've focused on formatting clarity, semantic rhythm, and mythic gravitas:

# 🌌 Sigil Neural Network

A Kintsugi-inspired neural architecture implementing Value-Weighted Pathway Reinforcement (VWPR) — treating errors as features rather than flaws.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

> *"In the art of Kintsugi, broken pottery is repaired with gold lacquer, making the flaw the most valuable part. Similarly, in this algorithm, high-error pathways are gilded, studied, and integrated as unique perspectives into the model's collective intelligence."*

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **Sigil Layers** — Neural layers that maintain ϕ (value weights) alongside standard weights  
- **Kintsugi Optimizer** — Implements VWPR (Value-Weighted Pathway Reinforcement)  
- **Dual-Stream Learning** — Simultaneous updates of network weights (θ) and value weights (ϕ)  
- **Constellation Mapping** — Visualizes the network's value-weighted pathways  

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python
from src.sigil_network import SigilNetwork
from src.kintsugi_optimizer import KintsugiOptimizer

# Create a Sigil Network
model = SigilNetwork([784, 128, 64, 10])

# Use Kintsugi optimizer (VWPR)
optimizer = KintsugiOptimizer(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, beta=0.1)

# Training loop with value-weight updates
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for x, y in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output, value_weights = model(x)
        loss = criterion(output, y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step(loss)  # VWPR update
```
