# 🌌 Sigil Neural Network

> *"In Kintsugi, cracks are mended with gold. In this network, errors are gilded into pathways of value."*

A **Kintsugi-inspired neural architecture** implementing **Value-Weighted Pathway Reinforcement (VWPR)** — an optimization framework where **errors are celebrated, not erased**, forging resilient, adaptive intelligence.

## ✨ Concept

Traditional AI seeks to *minimize* error.  
Sigil Networks **embrace the crack** instead:

- **Cracks as Features** – High-error connections are preserved and **gilded** rather than pruned.
- **Value-Weighted Learning** – Each pathway accumulates a secondary value weight (ϕ), measuring its *informational importance*.
- **Dual-Stream Optimization** – Simultaneous updates to:
  - Standard weights (θ) → function
  - Value weights (ϕ) → meaning

This leads to **graceful degradation**, **adaptive creativity**, and resistance to catastrophic forgetting.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The framework is composed of:

| Component            | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| **Sigil Layers** | Maintain both standard weights and value weights |
| **Kintsugi Optimizer** | Implements VWPR algorithm for gilding errors |
| **Constellation Mapping** | Visualizes value-weighted pathways |
| **Immune System Protocol** | Adds paradoxical containment for AI safety |
